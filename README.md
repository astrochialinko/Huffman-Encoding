# Huffman-Encoding

- CSC 345 Project (Fall 2023)
- Authors: Andres Silva-Castellanos, Luis Felix, Chia-Lin Ko, and Selina Lu

## Overview

We will try to construct a tree using Huffman Encoding. This will be done by taking input of Node objects containing a name and a frequency value. Then, we will put these elements in min-heap order as an array. The minimum values will be used to build the Huffman tree bottom-up. Then, we will traverse our tree to ensure accuracy/see the results. We will provide test cases and videos of the program running with test cases.
