## Overview

We will try to construct a tree using Huffman Encoding. This will be done by taking input of Node objects containing a name and a frequency value. Then, we will put these elements in min-heap order as an array. The minimum values will be used to build the Huffman tree bottom-up. Then, we will traverse our tree to ensure accuracy/see the results. We will provide test cases and videos of the program running with test cases.

To run the tests, run the program from either of the two files that end in 'Test'

## File Structure
The structure is pretty straightforward. There is a file for the actual Huffman and Shannon-Fano algorithms, then a class for the Node object that is used in both, as well as a MinHeap class used in the Huffman Encoding algorithm. Then, there are two test files to run test cases on each of the algorithms.
